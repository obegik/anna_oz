## First topic: "Noise" in the Nanopolish values of WT/KO bacteria strains in Anna's Run

1518 and 1519 positions in 16s are M26A. We see some fluctutation around these positions.

They are 20 nucleotides away from the end of the transcript

Possibility:
 - Due to the fact that they are closer to the transcript end
 - Stoichometry
 - Mapping issue

We can test the first possibility by plotting the line plots using mean values in windows


[We need something like this](https://github.com/obegik/anna_oz/blob/master/images/lineplot_mean.png)
